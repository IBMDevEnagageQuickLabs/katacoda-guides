## Great Work! You're done!

You have used MicroProfile Health to create an endpoint that reports on your Java microserviceâ€™s status. Then, you observed how Kubernetes uses the /health endpoint with the readiness probe to keep your microservices running smoothly.

If you would like to look at the code for these microservices follow the link to the github repository. For more information about the MicroProfile specification used in this tutorial, visit the MicroProfile website with the link below.

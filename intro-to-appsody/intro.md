Introduction to Appsody for cloud-native development

Kabanero is an open source project focused on bringing together key foundational open source technologies into a framework for developing and deploying modern cloud-native applications. The Kabanero developer experience is based on the Appsody and Eclipse Codewind open source projects enabling developers to use project 'templates' to rapidly create new cloud-native applications, develop and build them in a curated container 'stack' environment and deploy them to Knative/Kubernetes all without the need for container or Kubernetes skills

This tutorial will give you an introduction to the Appsody part of the Kabanero developer experience. You'll create and deploy a Java MicroProfile based cloud-native application, however, Kabanero provides a number of stacks, including Node.js and Spring Boot and is extensible so others can easily be added. For more information, see https://appsody.dev/

At the end of this tutorial, you should have a good understanding of how to use Appsody to develop and deploy a cloud-native application. You'll know how to create a new application, develop and deploy it to Kubernetes and have an appreciation for how Appsody does all the heavy-lifting helping you focus on the task of writing the code.

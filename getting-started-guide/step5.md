## Starting and stopping the Open Liberty server in the background 

Although you can start and stop the server in the foreground by using the Maven `liberty:run` goal, you can also start and stop the server in the background with the Maven `liberty:start` and `liberty:stop` goals:

`mvn liberty:start`{{execute}}

`mvn liberty:stop`{{execute}}

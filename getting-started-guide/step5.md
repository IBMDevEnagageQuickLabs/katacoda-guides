## Starting and stopping the Open Liberty server in the background 

Stop the server:

`q`{{execute}}

Although the `dev` goal has allowed for quicker turnarounds and an improved developer experience, you can also start and stop the server in the background with the Maven liberty:start and liberty:stop goals:

`mvn liberty:start`{{execute}}

`mvn liberty:stop`{{execute}}

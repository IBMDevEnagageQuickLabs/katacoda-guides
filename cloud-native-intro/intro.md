## Have a go at developing a cloud-native microservice on a fully open source and open standards stack.

 Use the Eclipse MicroProfile programming model to develop a robust and flexible microservice. Deploy it to the Open Liberty server running on the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM. Handle microservice metrics and alerting with MicroProfile Metrics and Health. Finally, build and run the application in a Docker container ready for deployment to your favourite cloud.

The online terminal is a pre-configured Linux environment that can be used as a regular console (you can type commands). Clicking on the blocks of code followed by the ENTER key will execute that command in the terminal.
